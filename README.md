## Current Status

- [EntityDef Lexer](./libs/entity-def-compiler/src/lib/lexer/Lexer.realworld.spec.ts)
  - Turns Entity Def files into tokens for further analysis, etc.
  - Usable: ðŸŸ¡
    - Several results from real world entityDef examples are shown in the [spec files](./libs/entity-def-compiler/src/lib/lexer/Lexer.realworld.spec.ts). Before I can put a ðŸŸ¢ on this though, I would need to battle test it by using other tools built on top of this, clarify some remaining questions regarding the syntax of entityDefs, and package it into a lib for anyone else to use.

## Repo Oerview

```sh
npx nx graph
```

## Finish your CI setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/KPB284Qacw)

## Generate a library

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
npx nx build pkg1
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```sh
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```
